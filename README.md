# E-commerce Analytics SQL Project

This project explores key business insights from an e-commerce dataset using advanced SQL queries. It covers user behaviour, product performance, funnel conversion rates, churn analysis, and more.

Each `.sql` file contains a specific business question or analytical goal, while the corresponding `.csv` file shows the results from executing the query.

# Structure

- `/sql/` – Contains all SQL scripts used for analysis
- `/csv/` – Contains the result of each query in CSV format
